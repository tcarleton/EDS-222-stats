## Welcome to EDS 222

Statistics is the science of collecting, manipulating, and analyzing empirical data. In this class, we will learn the statistical fundamentals that will enable us to draw conclusions about the environment and its interaction with social and economic systems. We will cover fundamental statistical concepts and tools, and then apply and expand upon those tools to learn some temporal and spatial statistical methods that are particularly helpful in environmental data science. Welcome!  

### Some concepts we'll cover:

- Sampling and study design, descriptive statistics

- Linear and logistic regression (univariate and multivariate)

- Hypothesis testing and inference

- Spatial weighting, spatial clustering

- Time series analysis, forecasting

<!-- - Moving window regression, spatial lag models, spatial auto-correlation -->

## Weekly course schedule

-   **Lectures:** Tuesday 9:30am - 10:45am (4016 Bren Hall)
-   **Labs:** Thursdays 9:30am - 10:45am (4016 Bren Hall)

## Learning objectives

The goal of this course is to enable MEDS students to confidently and competently apply statistical tools to environmental and socio-environmental datasets. 

-   **Master fundamental statistical concepts** and learn to apply them in `R`
-   **Design, conduct, and interpret linear and nonlinear regression models** 
-   **Apply spatial statistical methods** to environmental data
-   **Learn about and address** common spatial and temporal dependency issues that arise in environmental datasets
