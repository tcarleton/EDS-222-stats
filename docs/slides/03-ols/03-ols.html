# Relationships between variables
---
# Two random variables

### Often we are interested in the _relationship_ between two (or more) random variables.
E.g., heat waves and heart attacks, nitrogen fertilizer and water pollution

--

&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/scatter1-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Note: these are simulated data. But the violence-temperature link is real! See [here](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115430) for a summary of research.
---
# Two random variables

### What metrics can we use to characterize the _relationship_ between two variables? 

There are lots. But let's start with...

--

#### 1. Covariance


#### 2. Correlation

&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/scatter2-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Covariance 

#### **Variance** indicates how dispersed a distribution is (average squared deviation from the mean)

--

#### **Covariance** is a measure of the _joint_ distribution of two variables 

- Higher values of `\(X\)` correspond to higher values of `\(Y\)` `\(\rightarrow\)` **positive** covariance
- Higher values of `\(X\)` correspond to lower values of `\(Y\)` `\(\rightarrow\)` **negative** covariance 

--

In the population:
`$$Cov(X,Y) = E[(X-\mu_x)(Y-\mu_y)] = E[XY]-\mu_x\mu_y$$`

In the sample:
`$$s_{xy} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x)(y_i - \bar y)$$`
---
# Covariance 

#### **Variance** indicates how dispersed a distribution is (average squared deviation from the mean)

#### **Covariance** is a measure of the _joint_ distribution of two variables 

- Higher values of `\(X\)` correspond to higher values of `\(Y\)` `\(\rightarrow\)` **positive** covariance
- Higher values of `\(X\)` correspond to lower values of `\(Y\)` `\(\rightarrow\)` **negative** covariance 

--

#### The **sign** of `\(s_{xy}\)` tells us the sign of the linear relationship between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`, but the **magnitude** depends on the units of the variables and is therefore difficult to interpret

---
# Covariance

### Example: positive covariance
&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/covar1-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Covariance

### Example: zero covariance

&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/covar2-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Covariance

### Example: Negative covariance

&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/covar3-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

How do I interpret these units?! Hard to compare across these three graphs...

---

# Correlation

#### **Correlation** allows us to normalize covariance into interpretable units

--

The sign still tells us about the nature of the (linear) relationship between two variables:
  
  - **positive** covariance `\(\rightarrow\)` **positive** correlation (and vice versa)

But now, the magnitude is interpretable:
  
  - Ranges from -1 to 1, with magnitude indicating _strength_ of the relationship


---
# Correlation

#### **Correlation** allows us to normalize covariance into interpretable units  
  
In the population:
`$$\rho_{X,Y} = corr(X,Y) = \frac{cov(X,Y)}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}$$`
  
--

In the sample:
`$$r_{x,y} = \frac{s_{x,y}}{s_x s_y} = \frac{1}{(n-1)s_x s_y}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x)(y_i - \bar y)$$`
.footnote[
Want to proove that `\(-1 \leq r_{x,y} \leq 1\)` ? Key result: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality tells us that `\(|cov(X,Y)|^2 \leq var(X)var(Y)\)`.
]

---
  
# Correlation
  
### Example: Strong positive correlation

&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/corr1-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Correlation
  
### Example: zero correlation
  
&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/corr2-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Correlation
  
### Example: Moderate negative correlation
  
&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/corr3-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Ordinary Least Squares

---
# Linear regression

Covariance and correlation give us a single summary of the **strength** of the relationship between two random variables `\(Y\)` and `\(X\)`...

--

...but we want to know more!

--

In particular, we are often interested in the **linear** relationship between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`:

In the **population**:
$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + u $$
--

### Can we use our sample to estimate `\(\beta_0\)` (the intercept) and `\(\beta_1\)` (the slope)? 

---
# Finding a "best fit" line

Consider some sample data.

&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/lines1-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Finding a "best fit" line

For any line `\(\left(\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x\right)\)` `\(\color{#ffffff}{\bigg|}\)`

&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/lines2-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Finding a "best fit" line

For any line `\(\left(\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x\right)\)`, we can calculate errors: `\(e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i\)` `\(\color{#ffffff}{\bigg|}\)`

&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/lines3-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Finding a "best fit" line

For any line `\(\left(\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x\right)\)`, we can calculate errors: `\(e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i\)` `\(\color{#ffffff}{\bigg|}\)`

&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/lines4-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Finding a "best fit" line

For any line `\(\left(\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x\right)\)`, we can calculate errors: `\(e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i\)` `\(\color{#ffffff}{\bigg|}\)`

&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/lines5-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Ordinary Least Squares

### OLS chooses a line that minimizes the **sum of squared errors**:

`$$SSE = \sum_i (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 = \sum_i (y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x)^2$$`
#### In other words, OLS gives us a combination of `\(\hat\beta_0\)` and `\(\hat\beta_1\)` that minimizes the SSE.

#### Now you see where "least squares" comes from! 

### In .mono[R]:

`library(stats)`

`lm(y ~ x, my_data)`

#### Note: SSE is also called "sum of squared residuals" or SSR

---
# Ordinary Least Squares

SSE squares the errors `\(\left(\sum e_i^2\right)\)`: bigger errors get bigger penalties. `\(\color{#ffffff}{\bigg|}\)`

&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/lines6-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Ordinary Least Squares

The OLS estimate is the combination of `\(\hat{\beta}_0\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` that minimize SSE. `\(\color{#ffffff}{\bigg|}\)`

&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/lines7-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# OLS, formally

In simple linear regression, the OLS estimator comes from choosing the `\(\hat{\beta}_0\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` that minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE), _i.e._,

$$ \min_{\hat{\beta}_0,\, \hat{\beta}_1} \text{SSE} $$

--

but we already know `\(\text{SSE} = \sum_i e_i^2\)`. Now use the definitions of `\(e_i\)` and `\(\hat{y}\)`.

$$ e_i^2 = \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2 = \left( y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i \right)^2$$
this expands to:
$$ e_i^2= y_i^2 - 2 y_i \hat{\beta}_0 - 2 y_i \hat{\beta}_1 x_i + \hat{\beta}_0^2 + 2 \hat{\beta}_0 \hat{\beta}_1 x_i + \hat{\beta}_1^2 x_i^2$$

---
# OLS, formally

Choose the `\(\hat{\beta}_0\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` that minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE), _i.e._,

$$  \min_{\hat{\beta}_0,\, \hat{\beta}_1} \sum_i e_i^2 $$
**Derivation:** Minimizing a multivariate function requires (**1**) first derivatives equal zero (the *1.super[st]-order conditions*) and (**2**) second-order conditions (concavity).

--

**See extra slides** if you want the full derivation. Basically, we take the first derivatives of the SSE above with respect to `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`, set them equal to zero, and solve for `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`.

---
# OLS, formally

The OLS estimator for the slope is:

$$ \hat{\beta}_1 = \dfrac{\sum_i (x_i - \overline{x})(y_i - \overline{y})}{\sum_i (x_i - \overline{x})^2} = \frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)}$$

and the intercept:

$$ \hat{\beta}_0 = \overline{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \overline{x} $$

--

Note that the expression for `\(\hat\beta_0\)` can be rearranged to show us that our regression line always passes through the sample mean of `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`.


---
# Let's collect some definitions

True **population** relationship:
$$ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i $$

--

Estimated **sample** relationship:
$$ \hat y_i = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 x_i  $$
--

- **Dependent variable** = regressand = `\(y\)`
- **Independent variable** = explanatory variable = regressor = `\(x\)`
- **Residual** = sample error = `\(y_i - \hat y_i\)`
- Estimated **intercept** coefficient = `\(\hat\beta_0\)`
- Estimated **slope** coefficient = `\(\hat\beta_1\)`

---
# Why choose the OLS line?

### There are many possible ways to define a "best fit" linear relationship. For example:
- Least absolute deviations: minimize `\(\sum_i | y_i - \hat y_i|\)`
- Ridge regression: minimize `\(\sum_i \left[ (y_i - \hat y_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_k \hat\beta_k ^2 \right]\)`
- ...

---
# Why choose the OLS line?

### There are many possible ways to define a "best fit" linear relationship. 

### So why do we often rely on OLS?
- Under a key set of assumptions, OLS satisfies some very desirable properties that most statisticians, economists, political scientists put emphasis on

--

- However, you will see many other linear (and nonlinear) estimators in machine learning

--

- What estimator you use depends on what the goal of your analysis is, but OLS is the best option a LOT of the time

---
# Why choose the OLS line?

## Under key assumptions, OLS satisfies two desirable properties:

- OLS is **unbiased**.
- OLS has the **minimum variance** of all unbiased linear estimators.

--

Let's dig into each of these for a moment so you can appreciate how amazing OLS is.

---
# OLS property #1: Unbiasedness

### Under a key set of assumptions (we'll get into these in a few slides), OLS is **unbiased**

#### Unbiasedness:

On average (after *many* samples), does the estimator tend toward the true population value?

**More formally:** The mean of estimator's distribution equals the population parameter it estimates:

$$ \mathop{\text{Bias}}_\beta \left( \hat{\beta} \right) = \mathop{\boldsymbol{E}}\left[ \hat{\beta} \right] - \beta $$

---
# OLS property #1: Unbiasedness

### Under a key set of assumptions (we'll get into these in a few slides), OLS is **unbiased**

#### Unbiasedness:

On average (after *many* samples), does the estimator tend toward the true population value?

--

`\(\rightarrow\)` You should think about the distribution of `\(\hat \beta\)` values as the distribution of regression results you would get if you could draw many random samples from the population and generate a new `\(\hat\beta\)` every time. 

--

`\(\rightarrow\)` In two weeks we'll talk a lot more about uncertainty in and distributions of estimators like `\(\hat\beta\)`.

]

---
# OLS property #2: Lowest variance

### Under a key set of assumptions (again, let's wait a couple slides), OLS is the estimator with the **lowest variance**

#### Lowest variance:

Just as we discussed when defining summary statistics, the central tendencies (means) of distributions are not the only things that matter. We also care about the **variance** of an estimator.

$$ \mathop{\text{Var}} \left( \hat{\beta} \right) = \mathop{\boldsymbol{E}}\left[ \left( \hat{\beta} - \mathop{\boldsymbol{E}}\left[ \hat{\beta} \right] \right)^2 \right] $$

Lower variance estimators mean we get estimates closer to the mean in each sample.

---
# OLS property #2: Lowest variance

#### Lowest variance:

Just as we discussed when defining summary statistics, the central tendencies (means) of distributions are not the only things that matter. We also care about the **variance** of an estimator.

`\(\rightarrow\)` Again, think about the distribution of `\(\hat \beta\)` values as the distribution of regression results you would get if you could draw many random samples from the population and generate a new `\(\hat\beta\)` every time.

# OLS property #2: Lowest variance

---
# Properties of OLS


**Property 1: Bias.**

**Property 2: Variance.**

**Subtlety:** The bias-variance tradeoff.

Should we be willing to take a bit of bias to reduce the variance?

In much of statistics, we choose unbiased estimators. But other disciplines (especially computer science) will choose estimators that sacrifice some bias in exchange for lower variance. 

--

You'll learn more about these estimators (e.g., ridge regression) in EDS 232 👀

# OLS: Assumptions

These very nice properties depend on a key set of assumptions:

--

1. The population relationship is linear in parameters with an additive disturbance.

--

2. Our `\(X\)` variable is **exogenous**, _i.e._, `\(\mathop{\boldsymbol{E}}\left[ u \mid X \right] = 0\)`.
  + I.e., is there no other variable correlated with `\(X\)` that also affects `\(Y\)`
  + You will talk a lot more about this in EDS 241 👀

--

3. The `\(X\)` variable has variation (and if there are multiple explanatory variables, they are not perfectly collinear)
  + Recall, `\(var(x)\)` is in the denominator of the OLS slope coefficient estimator!
  
---
# OLS: Assumptions

1. The population relationship is linear in parameters with an additive disturbance.

2. Our `\(X\)` variable is **exogenous**, _i.e._, `\(\mathop{\boldsymbol{E}}\left[ u \mid X \right] = 0\)`.

3. The `\(X\)` variable has variation. 

4. The population disturbances `\(u_i\)` are independently and identically distributed as **normal** random variables with mean zero `\(\left( \mathop{\boldsymbol{E}}\left[ u \right] = 0 \right)\)` and variance `\(\sigma^2\)` (_i.e._,  `\(\mathop{\boldsymbol{E}}\left[ u^2 \right] = \sigma^2\)`)
  + Independently distributed and mean zero jointly imply `\(\mathop{\boldsymbol{E}}\left[ u_i u_j \right] = 0\)` for any `\(i\neq j\)`
  + Constant variance means errors cannot vary with `\(X\)` (this is called "homoskedasticity")
  
---
# OLS: Assumptions

Different assumptions guarantee different properties:

- Assumptions (1), (2), and (3) make OLS **unbiased**
- Assumption (4) gives us an unbiased estimator for the **variance** of our OLS estimator (we will talk more about this when covering _inference_ in a couple weeks)

--

We will discuss the many ways real life may **violate these assumptions**. For instance:

- Non-linear relationships in our parameters/disturbances (or misspecification) `\(\rightarrow\)` e.g., logistic regression
- Disturbances that are not identically distributed and/or not independent `\(\rightarrow\)` lectures on _inference_
- Violations of exogeneity (especially omitted-variable bias) `\(\rightarrow\)` mostly covered in EDS 241

---
# OLS: Assumptions

### Q: Can we test these assumptions?

&gt; A: Some of them.

#### Assumption 1: Linear in parameters. 

You can look at your data to see if this might be reasonable.

# OLS: Assumptions

### Q: Can we test these assumptions?

&gt; A: Some of them.

#### Assumption 1: Linear in parameters. 

You can look at your data to see if this might be reasonable. 

- Note: this assumption does not require your model to be linear in `\(X\)`! As we discuss later, nonlinear relationships in `\(X\)` _can_ be easily accommodated with OLS:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + \varepsilon_i$$`

This equation was estimated using OLS to give the nonlinear relationship on the next slide.

---
# OLS: Assumptions

### Q: Can we test these assumptions?

&gt; A: Some of them.

#### Assumption 2: Exogeneity

`$$\mathop{\boldsymbol{E}}\left[ u \mid X \right] = 0$$`


#### This is not a testable assumption! 

There are a lot of methods designed to probe this assumption, but it's fundamentally untestable since there are infinite possible correlates of `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` that are unobservable to the researcher.

In general, you should always think about what is in `\(u\)` that may be correlated with `\(X\)`.

---
# OLS: Assumptions

### Q: Can we test these assumptions?

&gt; A: Some of them.

#### Assumption 3: `\(X\)` has variation. 

This is very easy to test:

### Q: Can we test these assumptions?

&gt; A: Some of them.

#### Assumption 4: The population disturbances `\(u_i\)` are independently and identically distributed as **normal** random variables with mean zero and variance `\(\sigma^2\)` 

--

Use the residuals from your regression to investigate this assumption

--

Step 1: Run linear regression
$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i $$
Step 2: Generate residuals

`$$e_i = y_i - \hat y_i$$`

--

Use the residuals from your regression to investigate this assumption

Step 3: Plot and investigate residuals [draw these examples]
  + histogram (are they normal?)
  + plot of `\(e_i\)` against `\(X\)` (are they uncorrelated? does the variance depend on `\(X\)`?)

### Goal: quantify how "well" your regression model fits the data

#### General idea: Larger variance in residuals suggests our model isn't very predictive

# Coefficient of determination

- We already learned one measure of the strength of a linear relationship: correlation, `\(r\)`

--

- In OLS, we often rely on `\(R^2\)`, the **coefficient of determination**. In simple linear regression, this is simply the square of the correlation.
- Interpretation of `\(R^2\)`: **share of the variance in `\(y\)` that is explained by `\(x\)`**

--
$$
SSR = \text{sum of squared residuals} = \sum_i (y_i - \hat y_i)^2 = \sum_i e_i^2 
$$

$$
SST = \text{total sum of squares} = \sum_i (y_i - \bar y)^2 
$$

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSR}{SST} = 1 - \frac{\sum_i e_i^2}{\sum_i (y_i - \bar y)^2}
$$


---
# Coefficient of determination

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSR}{SST} = 1 - \frac{\sum_i e_i^2}{\sum_i (y_i - \bar y)^2}
$$
--

- `\(R^2\)` varies between 0 and 1: Perfect model with `\(e_i=0\)` for all `\(i\)` has `\(R^2=1\)`. `\(R^2=0\)` if we just guess the mean `\(\bar y\)`.

--

- In more complex models, `\(R^2\)` is not the same as the square of the correlation coefficient. You should think of them as related but distinct concepts.

# Coefficient of determination

#### Definition: % of variance in `\(y\)` that is explained by `\(x\)` (and any other independent variables)

--

- Describes a _linear_ relationship between `\(y\)` and `\(\hat y\)`
 
--

- Higher `\(R^2\)` does not mean a model is "better" or more appropriate
  + Predictive power is not often the goal of regression analysis (e.g., you may just care about getting `\(\beta_1\)` right)
  + If you are focused on predictive power, many other measures of fit are appropriate (to discuss in machine learning)
  + Always look at your data and residuals! 
  
--

- Like OLS in general, `\(R^2\)` is very sensitive to outliers. Again...always look at your data!

---
# Coefficient of determination 

Here, `\(R^2=0.94\)`. Does that mean a linear model is appropriate?


&lt;img src="03-ols_files/figure-html/rsq-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Coefficient of determination 

Here, `\(R^2=0\)`. Does that mean there is no relationship between these variables?

# Important notes on OLS

---
# Outliers

Because OLS minimizes the sum of the **squared** errors, outliers can play a large role in our estimates.

**Common responses**

- Remove the outliers from the dataset

- Replace outliers with the 99&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile of their variable (*winsorize*)

- Take the log of the variable (This lowers the leverage of large values -- why?)

- Do nothing. Outliers are not always bad. Some people are "far" from the average. It may not make sense to try to change this variation.

---
# Missing data

Similarly, missing data can affect your results.

.mono[R] doesn't know how to deal with a missing observation.

```r
1 + 2 + 3 + NA + 5
```

```
#&gt; [1] NA
```

If you run a regression&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; with missing values, .mono[R] drops the observations missing those values.

If the observations are missing in a nonrandom way, a random sample may end up nonrandom.
  + This is *systematic non-response* from Lecture 01

# Multiple linear regression (preview)

The true population model probably involves **other regressors**:

$$ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + ... + \beta_k x_{ik} + \varepsilon_i  $$

This raises many questions:

--

- Which `\(x\)`'s should I include? This is the problem of "model selection".

--

- How does my interpretation of `\(\beta_1\)` change?

--

- What if my `\(x\)`'s interact with each other? E.g., race and gender, temperature and rainfall.

--

- How do I measure model fit now?

# OLS, formally
  
In simple linear regression, the OLS estimator comes from choosing the `\(\hat{\beta}_0\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` that minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE), _i.e._,

$$ \min_{\hat{\beta}_0,\, \hat{\beta}_1} \text{SSE} $$
  
--
  
but we already know `\(\text{SSE} = \sum_i e_i^2\)`. Now use the definitions of `\(e_i\)` and `\(\hat{y}\)`.

$$ e_i^2 = \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2 = \left( y_i - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_i \right)^2$$ 

this expands to:

$$ e_i^2 = y_i^2 - 2 y_i \hat{\beta}_0 - 2 y_i \hat{\beta}_1 x_i + \hat{\beta}_0^2 + 2 \hat{\beta}_0 \hat{\beta}_1 x_i + \hat{\beta}_1^2 x_i^2$$
  
--
  
**Recall:** Minimizing a multivariate function requires (**1**) first derivatives equal zero (the *1.super[st]-order conditions*) and (**2**) second-order conditions (concavity).

---
# OLS, formally
  
We're getting close. We need to **minimize SSE**. We've showed how SSE relates to our sample (our data: `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`) and our estimates (_i.e._, `\(\hat{\beta}_0\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)`).

$$ \text{SSE} = \sum_i e_i^2 = \sum_i \left( y_i^2 - 2 y_i \hat{\beta}_0 - 2 y_i \hat{\beta}_1 x_i + \hat{\beta}_0^2 + 2 \hat{\beta}_0 \hat{\beta}_1 x_i + \hat{\beta}_1^2 x_i^2 \right) $$
  
For the first-order conditions of minimization, we now take the first derivates of SSE with respect to `\(\hat{\beta}_0\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)`.

$$
  \begin{aligned}
\dfrac{\partial \text{SSE}}{\partial \hat{\beta}_0} &amp;= \sum_i \left( 2 \hat{\beta}_0 + 2 \hat{\beta}_1 x_i - 2 y_i \right) = 2n \hat{\beta}_0 + 2 \hat{\beta}_1 \sum_i x_i - 2 \sum_i y_i \\
&amp;= 2n \hat{\beta}_0 + 2n \hat{\beta}_1 \overline{x} - 2n \overline{y}
\end{aligned}
$$
  
where `\(\overline{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}\)` and `\(\overline{y} = \frac{\sum y_i}{n}\)` are sample means of `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` (size `\(n\)`).

---
# OLS, formally
  
The first-order conditions state that the derivatives are equal to zero, so:
  
  $$ \dfrac{\partial \text{SSE}}{\partial \hat{\beta}_0} = 2n \hat{\beta}_0 + 2n \hat{\beta}_1 \overline{x} - 2n \overline{y} = 0 $$
  
which implies

$$ \hat{\beta}_0 = \overline{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \overline{x} $$
  
Now for `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)`.

---
# OLS, formally
  
Take the derivative of SSE with respect to `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)`
  
$$
\dfrac{\partial \text{SSE}}{\partial \hat{\beta}_1} &amp;= \sum_i \left( 2 \hat{\beta}_0 x_i + 2 \hat{\beta}_1 x_i^2 - 2 y_i x_i \right) = 2 \hat{\beta}_0 \sum_i x_i + 2 \hat{\beta}_1 \sum_i x_i^2 - 2 \sum_i y_i x_i $$

$$ = 2n \hat{\beta}_0 \overline{x} + 2 \hat{\beta}_1 \sum_i x_i^2 - 2 \sum_i y_i x_i
$$
  
set it equal to zero (first-order conditions, again)

$$ \dfrac{\partial \text{SSE}}{\partial \hat{\beta}_1} = 2n \hat{\beta}_0 \overline{x} + 2 \hat{\beta}_1 \sum_i x_i^2 - 2 \sum_i y_i x_i = 0 $$
  
and substitute in our relationship for `\(\hat{\beta}_0\)`, _i.e._, `\(\hat{\beta}_0 = \overline{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \overline{x}\)`. Thus,

$$
  2n \left(\overline{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \overline{x}\right) \overline{x} + 2 \hat{\beta}_1 \sum_i x_i^2 - 2 \sum_i y_i x_i = 0
$$
  
---
# OLS, formally
  
Continuing from the last slide

$$ 2n \left(\overline{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \overline{x}\right) \overline{x} + 2 \hat{\beta}_1 \sum_i x_i^2 - 2 \sum_i y_i x_i = 0 $$
  
we multiply out

$$ 2n \overline{y}\,\overline{x} - 2n \hat{\beta}_1 \overline{x}^2 + 2 \hat{\beta}_1 \sum_i x_i^2 - 2 \sum_i y_i x_i = 0 $$
  
$$ \implies 2 \hat{\beta}_1 \left( \sum_i x_i^2 - n \overline{x}^2 \right) = 2 \sum_i y_i x_i - 2n \overline{y}\,\overline{x} $$
  
$$ \implies \hat{\beta}_1 = \dfrac{\sum_i y_i x_i - 2n \overline{y}\,\overline{x}}{\sum_i x_i^2 - n \overline{x}^2} = \dfrac{\sum_i (x_i - \overline{x})(y_i - \overline{y})}{\sum_i (x_i - \overline{x})^2} $$
  
---
# OLS, formally
  
Done!
  
We now have (lovely) OLS estimators for the slope

$$ \hat{\beta}_1 = \dfrac{\sum_i (x_i - \overline{x})(y_i - \overline{y})}{\sum_i (x_i - \overline{x})^2} $$
  
and the intercept

$$ \hat{\beta}_0 = \overline{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \overline{x} $$
  
And now you know where the *least squares* part of ordinary least squares comes from. 🎊
