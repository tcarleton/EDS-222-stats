# Types of variables

## Numerical variables
&gt; Object class `numeric` in `R`
- Can take on a wide range of possible values
- Makes sense to add, subtract, multiply, etc.

--
 
- Examples: 
  + Height of the tree canopy across the Amazon
  + Length of Atlantic swordfish
  + Daily average temperature

#### **Discrete** numerical variables take on only a limited set of values, often counts (e.g., population)
#### **Continuous** numerical variables: can take on infinite values within a range (e.g., arsenic concentration in groundwater)

# Types of variables

## Categorical variables
&gt; Object class `factor` in `R`

- Values correspond to one of a fixed number of categories
- Possible values are called **levels** 

--
 
- Examples: 
  + Land use type
  + Species of tree
  + Age group (e.g., &lt;15, 15-64, 65+) (watch out! continuous numerical data can often be stored as a categorical variable!)

---
# Types of variables

## Categorical variables

#### **Nominal** variables are unordered descriptions
#### **Ordinal** variables are categories with a natural ordering
#### **Binary** variables only take on 0 or 1

# Probability density functions

# Probability density functions

Remember: when we do statistics, we use _statistics_ from a sample to learn about _parameters_ of a population.

--

A **variable** is a representation of something we care about in a population (e.g., nitrate concentration of groundwater). 

--

Many parameters we care about tell us something about what values we might see for our variable in the population (e.g., average nitrate concentrations). 

--

**Probability density functions** are mathematical functions that tell us: how likely are we to see values of a given range?

&lt;img src="drinkingwater.jpeg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Probability density functions

For _continuous_ variables, the **probability density function (p.d.f.)** tells us the probability that a variable falls within a given range of values. 

Formally: The **p.d.f.** of a continuous variable `\(X\)` with support (i.e., range of possible values) `\(S\)` is an integrable function `\(f(x)\)` satisfying:

--

1. `\(f(x)\)` is positive for all `\(x\)` in `\(S\)`

--

2. The area under the curve `\(f(x)\)` over the entire support `\(S\)` is equal to 1: $$ \int_S f(x)dx = 1$$

--

3. The probability that `\(x\)` falls between `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` is: $$ Pr(A\leq x \leq B) = \int_A^B f(x)dx $$

---
# Why isn't this simpler?

&gt; Q: Why can't I just interpret `\(f(x)\)` as the probability that `\(X=x\)`?

&gt; A: Because continuous variables have `\(\infty\)` possible values...the probability that your variable `\(X\)` exactly equals `\(x\)` is zero! 

--

### Luckily, for **discrete variables** it _is_ this simple!

For _discrete_ variable `\(x\)` , the **probability mass function (p.m.f.)** `\(f(x)\)` tells us the probability that `\(X = x\)`.

Formally: The **p.m.f.** of a discrete variable `\(X\)` with support (i.e., range of possible values) `\(S\)` is a function `\(f(x)\)` satisfying:

1. `\(P(X=x) = f(x) &gt;0\)` for all `\(x\)` in support `\(S\)`

2. `\(\sum_{x\in S} f(x) = 1\)`

3. `\(P(A\leq x \leq B) = \sum_{x=A}^{x=B} f(x)\)`

---
# Probability density functions (visual)

P.d.f.'s help us characterize the distribution of our population. The most common/famous ones get names (e.g., normal, Gamma, `\(t\)`,...)

### Let's look at a **normal** distribution*
The probability this normally distributed variable takes on a value between -2 and 0 is shown in pink:

&lt;img src="02-summstats_files/figure-html/examplepdf-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
&lt;font size="3"&gt; `\(^*\)`This distribution happens to be what's called "standard" normal. We'll get into the weeds later!&lt;/font&gt; 
---
# Probability density functions (visual)

### Let's look at a **normal** distribution*
The probability this normally distributed variable takes on a value between -2 and 2 is shown in pink:

&lt;img src="02-summstats_files/figure-html/examplepdf2-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

&lt;font size="3"&gt; `\(^*\)`Yep, still a "standard" normal. Details later. &lt;/font&gt;
---
# The normal distribution

There are infinite different normal distributions. They all have the following p.d.f.:

$$f(x) =\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)} $$
where `\(\mu\)` is the mean (i.e., average) and `\(\sigma\)` is the standard deviation (will define soon). `\(\mu\)` and `\(\sigma\)` are **parameters** describing the population p.d.f.

&lt;img src="normals.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
#### Many results in statistics rely on the assumption that our data are normally distributed. We will return to this distribution **frequently!**

---
# Shapes of probability distributions

Key terms to describe p.d.f.'s:

1. A distribution can have **skew** (e.g., log-normal)
2. A distribution can have a long **right tail** or **left tail** (e.g., fat-tailed climate sensitivity distributions!)
3. A distribution can be **symmetric**
4. A distribution can be **unimodal**, **bimodal**, or **multimodal**

# Summary statistics

# Describing random variables

A probability density function describes a **population**

As we learned last week, we rarely have a **census** so we rarely can directly describe the p.d.f. itself.

--

Instead, we use **statistics** from a _sample_ to estimate **parameters** of the _population_. Randomness in sampling means we call the variables in our sample "random variables"

&lt;img src="02-summstats_files/figure-html/examplepdf3-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Measures of central tendency

### We often begin to describe a distribution using measures of **central tendency** (i.e., measures of the "middle").

Three are most common:
1. **Mean** 
2. **Median**
3. **Mode**

---
# Mean = expected value = average

In a **population**, the mean is defined as: `$$\mathrm{E}[X]=\mu=\int_S xf(x)dx$$`

--

In our **sample**, we compute the mean as: `$$\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\in n} x_i$$`

#### We use `\(\bar{x}\)` as an *estimate* of the parameter of interest, `\(\mu\)`.

&lt;img src="02-summstats_files/figure-html/examplemean-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Median = middle value 

In a **population**, the median `\(m\)` is defined as: `$$P(X\leq m) = \int_{-\infty}^m f(x)dx = \frac{1}{2} = \int_m^{\infty} f(x)dx = P(X\geq m)$$`

--

In our **sample**, we order all our data from lowest to highest and then compute the median as: 
- `\(n\)` even? median = mean of the middle two values
- `\(n\)` odd? median = middle value

&lt;img src="02-summstats_files/figure-html/examplemedian-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Median and mean are not always close

#### Non-normal distribution `\(\implies\)` median and mean can diverge substantially

&lt;img src="02-summstats_files/figure-html/examplemedian2-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Mode = most frequent value

### The **mode** is simply the most frequently observed value 

This is much more useful for discrete data (ask yourself why!)

&lt;img src="02-summstats_files/figure-html/examplemode-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Measures of spread

### Central tendency only gets us so far...we also need measures of **spread**.

1. **Range** (easy: min to max of your data)
2. **Variance**
3. **Standard deviation**
4. **Quantiles**

---

# Measures of spread: Variance

Answers the question, how far are observations from the mean, on average? 

In the population: `$$Var(X) = \mathrm{E}[(X-\mu)^2] = \sigma^2 = \int_{\mathrm S} (x-\mu)^2f(x)dx$$`

In the sample: $$ s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i \in n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$
&gt; Q: Why do we divide by `\(n-1\)`? 

&gt; A: Lots of math to prove it (see [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/summarizing-quantitative-data-ap/more-standard-deviation/v/review-and-intuition-why-we-divide-by-n-1-for-the-unbiased-sample-variance)), but trust me, `\(s^2\)` will be a biased estimate of `\(\sigma^2\)` if you divide by `\(n\)`!

#### Units of variance: units of the random variable, _squared_

---
# Measures of spread: Standard deviation 

Just the square root of the variance!  

In the population: `$$SD(X) = \sqrt{\mathrm{E}[(X-\mu)^2]} = \sigma = \sqrt{\int_{\mathrm S} (x-\mu)^2f(x)dx}$$`

In the sample: $$ s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i \in n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}$$

#### Units of standard deviation: units of the random variable

---

# Some helpful rules

$$\mathrm{E}[aX+b] = a\mathrm{E}[X] + b $$
$$\mathrm{E}[X+Y] = \mathrm{E}[X] + \mathrm{E}[Y] $$
`$$var(X) = \mathrm{E}[X^2] - (\mathrm{E}[X])^2$$`
`$$var(aX+b) = a^2var(X)$$`

---
# Variance, visually
 

**Pink**: Low variance/standard deviation `\(\sigma = 1\)`

**Green**: High variance/standard deviation `\(\sigma = 2\)`

&lt;img src="02-summstats_files/figure-html/lowvariance-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Variance, visually

#### Back to the normal distributions
- Changes in the _mean_ shift the distribution right to left
- Changes in the _standard deviation_ stretch the distribution out (or shrink it in)

&lt;img src="normals.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Measures of spread: Quantiles

### Quantiles are cut points of a probability distribution

In our sample, quantiles are cut points of our sample data

#### How do we compute them?

- We order our data from lowest to highest

- For the `\(q\)`-quantile, we divide these ordered data into `\(q\)` equal sized subsamples 
- The value at the edge of the `\(k\)`th subsample is the `\(k\)`th `\(q\)`-quantile
  + This tells you the value below which `\(\frac{k}{q}\)` of the data lie

--

&gt; Question: How many `\(q\)`-quantiles are there for any given `\(q\)`?

--

&gt; Answer: There are `\(q-1\)` of the `\(q\)`-quantiles

---
# Example: The normal distribution

Common quantiles have names you have head of, such as _quartiles_ for `\(q=4\)`:

&lt;div class="figure" style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="quantiles_normal.png" alt="Quartiles of the normal distribution" width="50%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Quartiles of the normal distribution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

**Interpretation:** Q1 = first quartile, Q2 = second quartile, etc. The area below the red curve is the same below Q1 as it is between Q1 and Q2, between Q2 and Q3, and above Q3. 
---
# Common quantiles and interpretation

### Common quantiles have names you have heard of: 
- `\(q=2\)` **Median** tells us the value for which 50% of our sample sits _below_ (and 50% above). This is quantile 0.5 (or 50% quantile)
- `\(q=3\)` **Terciles**: tell us the values for which 33.33% (1st tercile) and 66.66% (2nd tercile) of our sample sits _below_
- `\(q=4\)` **Quartiles**: tell us the values for which 25% (1st quartile), 50% (2nd quartile), and 75% (3rd quartile) of our sample sits _below_
- `\(q=10\)` **Deciles**: tell us the values for which 10% (1st decile), ..., 50% (5th decile), ..., and 90% (9th decile) of our sample sits _below_

--

`\(q\)` The k_th_ `\(q\)`-quantile tells us the value for which `\(\frac{k}{q}\times 100\)`% of our sample sits _below_


---
# This sounds a lot like percentiles...

### Percentiles are simply quantiles for q=100!

#### We hear about percentiles in daily life more often, and in practice people often use "percentiles" language for the more general term "quantiles". 

#### Examples of percentiles:
- At 5'3", my height is the 40th percentile of the U.S. adult female height distribution `\(\rightarrow\)` 40% of American female adults are shorter than me
- At 36 lbs, my son is the 90th percentile of U.S. male 3 year old weight distribution `\(\rightarrow\)` 90% of American male 3 year olds are lighter than my son

&gt; Exercise: Draw approximately where you think the 1st, 10th, 20th, 50th, 80th, 90th and 99th percentiles would be on a normal distribution. 

---
# Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plots

### **Histograms** plot the frequency of our data within bins
  - `geom_histogram()` with `ggplot2` in `R`
  
### **Q-Q plots** plot the quantiles of our data _against_ quantiles of some theoretical distribution
  - `geom_qq()` with `ggplot2` in `R`

&gt; This is helpful if we want to ask things like, are my data approximately normally distributed? 

#### Straight line on a Q-Q plot indicates sample and theoretical distributions match

---

&gt; We will continually return to the normal distribution. Always a good idea to check whether your data look normally distributed or not!

# Which statistics are robust to outliers?

- Consider a sample of loans from a bank, each with an associated interest rate `\(x\)`. 
  + `\(\bar x = 11.57%\)`
  + `\(s=5.05%\)`
  
- The highest value in the data is somewhat of an outlier, `\(x_{max} = 26.3%\)`.
