# Today

## Why are we here? 

What is statistics? Why do we need it as environmental data scientists? 

## Details

Into the syllabus weeds 🌱

## Getting started: Sample vs. population

- What is a sample? What is a population?
- How are samples constructed?
- Study design: how are samples constructed to fit a question?

# Why are we we here? 

## Statistics:
The science of **collecting**, **manipulating**, and **analyzing** empirical data

### Statistics enables us to use environmental data to follow the **scientific method** 
<!-- $\longrightarrow$ Origins: Aristotle's logic, Francis Bacon's empiricism -->
```{r, out.width = "45%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("The_Scientific_Method.svg")
```
---

# The scientific method: Example

### **Step one:** Make an observation (cool, don't need stats)

#### Ex: When Mt. Pinatubo erupted in 1991, much less sunlight was available for plants...
- 20 Mt of sulfur dioxide $\longrightarrow$ increased stratospheric sulfate aerosols, decreased sunlight reaching Earth's surface

```{r, out.width = "60%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("ash-cloud2.jpeg")
```

---

# The scientific method: Example

### **Step two:**  Ask a question (easy, also don't need stats)

#### Ex: I wonder if these aerosols could decrease crop yields?


```{r, out.width = "80%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("cropmodel.jpeg")
```

---

# The scientific method: Example

### **Step three:**  Form a hypothesis / testable explanation (sounding somewhat stats-like, but still no pre-req's here)

#### Ex: Did less sunlight from Mt. Pinatubo's aerosols lead to lower crop yields?
```{r, out.width = "45%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("proctoretalfig2.png")
```

_Source_: Proctor et al. (_Nature_, 2018)
---

# The scientific method: Example

### **Steps four/five:**  Analyze data & test the hypothesis 
(** !! NEED STATISTICS !! **)

#### Ex: Assemble spatio-temporal dataset, run multivariate linear regression, test statistical significance of regression parameters
```{r, out.width = "70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("proctoretalfig3.png")
```

---

# The scientific method: Example

### **Step six:**  Report conclusions & what they mean for your question

#### Ex: Run simulation to consider the implications for solar radiation management (a form of geo-engineering)
```{r, out.width = "75%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("proctoretalfig4.png")
```

---
# Statistics and the scientific method

- Statistics will enable us to **test hypotheses**, **analyze data**, and **draw conclusions** about the world from the process

- Otherwise, we'd be stuck at **observing** and **forming hypotheses**

- ... and we'd have a lot of unanswered empirical questions! 

```{r, out.width = "40%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("The_Scientific_Method.svg")
```

# This course within MEDS

### This course **is**:
- Designed to build your fundamental statistical toolkit
- Designed to teach you to _apply_ statistics in `R` 
- Designed to show you key spatio-temporal methods that come up frequently in environmental data science
- **Brand new!** $\longrightarrow$ Things will not go according to plan. But you can help shape the curriculum!

### This course is **not**:
- A programming class $\longrightarrow$ I will make mistakes. I don't know all the new exciting things. I will learn from you!
- A class in program evaluation/causal inference (👀 EDS 241)
- A class in spatial data analysis (👀 EDS 223)

# Sample versus population

Consider a potential research question:
> What is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean?

--

###Some definitions

-- 

- **Population**: The entire target population of interest.
  - Ex: All swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean
  
--

- **Census**: A data collection including _all_ individuals in the population
  + Ex: Count every single swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean (hard and 💰)
  
-- 

- **Sample**: A subset of the target population for which we actually have data
  + Ex: 60 tagged swordfish from a government survey in the Atlantic Ocean
  
---
# Parameters and statistics
<!-- $$\\[1in]$$ --> 

#### Usually we are interested in a numerical summary of the _population_ (e.g., mean, slope, intercept, variance)

- **Parameter**: A numerical summary of the **population**
  + Ex: _average_ mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean

- **Statistic**: A numerical summary of the **sample**
  + Ex: _average_ mercury content of the 60 swordfish collected in a government survey in the Atlantic Ocean


#### We use _statistics_ (from a sample) in hopes of learning about _parameters_ (from the population)

- This means that every time you do ``statistics'', you should be thinking...
  + What is the population of interest?
  + What is my sample?
  + How are they different?
  
---
# All samples are not created equal

From _IMS_: Suppose we want to estimate time to graduation for Duke undergraduates in the last five years using a sample of recent students.
- Q: Who is the population?

Suppose we take a **random** sample (i.e., every individual in the population has the same probability of being selected)

```{r, fig.cap="10 graduates are randomly selected from the population to be included in the sample.", fig.asp = 0.5, fig.width = 8, out.width = "70%", echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
par_og <- par(no.readonly = TRUE) # save original par
par(mar = rep(0, 4))
plot(c(0, 2), c(0, 1.1), type = "n", axes = FALSE, xlab = "", ylab = "")
temp <- seq(0, 2 * pi, 2 * pi / 100)
x <- 0.5 + 0.5 * cos(temp)
y <- 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(temp)
lines(x, y)
s <- matrix(runif(1000), ncol = 2)
S <- matrix(NA, 350, 2)
j <- 0
for (i in 1:nrow(s)) {
  if (sum((s[i, ] - 0.5)^2) < 0.23) {
    j <- j + 1
    S[j, ] <- s[i, ]
  }
}
points(S, col = "steelblue", pch = 20)
text(0.5, 1, "all graduates", pos = 3, cex = 1.3)
set.seed(50)
N <- sample(j, 25)
lines((x - 0.5) / 2 + 1.5, (y - 0.5) / 2 + 0.5, pch = 20)
SS <- (S[N, ] - 0.5) / 2 + 0.5
these <- c(2, 5, 10, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 1, 8)
points(SS[these, 1] + 1, SS[these, 2], col = "indianred", pch = 20, cex = 1.5)
text(1.5, 0.75, "sample", pos = 3, cex = 1.3)
for (i in these) {
  arrows(S[N[i], 1], S[N[i], 2],
         SS[i, 1] + 1 - 0.03, SS[i, 2],
         length = 0.08, col = "black", lwd = 1.5

- What might go wrong here?

# All samples are not created equal

When a sample is _not_ drawn randomly, it is likely your statistic will be a biased estimate of the population parameter

Some other examples of biased sampling:

- **Systematic non-response** (e.g., only people from a certain group respond to the phone survey)

- **Convenience sampling** (e.g., biologists only take forest transects near the edge of a large forested area)  

--

Under-represented groups may be particularly misrepresented due to improper sampling

- Rolf et al., ["Representation Matters"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03399)
  + Show the value of diverse samples for training machine learning algorithms 
  
- Buolamwini et al., ["Gender shades"](http://gendershades.org/)
  + Facial analysis benchmark datasets (i.e., samples) are overwhelmingly white, leading to misclassification for darker-skinned subjects

# Four (random) sampling strategies

Nearly all statistical methods are based on assumptions of randomness. If data are not collected randomly from the population, estimates are likely to be biased. 

### Strategy 1: Simple random sampling

- As simple as it sounds!
- To consider for later classes: What problems might arise if your (simple random) sample is small?

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Source: IMS"}
knitr::include_graphics("simplerand_sample.png")
```

---

# Four (random) sampling strategies

### Strategy 2: Stratified sampling

- More complex to analyze sample to construct estimates of population parameters (but still possible)
- Helpful when individuals within a strata are quite similar
- Used often as a method of variance reduction (we'll discuss this later)

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Source: IMS"}
knitr::include_graphics("stratified_sample.png")
```

---

# Four (random) sampling strategies

### Strategy 3: Cluster random sampling

- Helpful when individuals within a cluster are quite _different_ from one another
- Used often when costs of data collection are high per cluster (e.g., Demographic and Health Surveys)
- Also more complex to estimate population parameters

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Source: IMS"}
knitr::include_graphics("cluster_sample.png")
```

---

# Four (random) sampling strategies


### Strategy 4: Multi-stage sampling

- Very similar to cluster sampling, just take fewer samples (randomly)

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Source: IMS"}
knitr::include_graphics("clusterrand_sample.png")
```

---
# Study design

### When we conduct statistical analyses, where do our samples come from?

- **Experimental** studies
  + Sample is collected to fit the study's needs
  
- **Observational** studies
  + Sample exists, design your study to make best use of available data

--

### In both cases, the researcher generally aims to _causally_ identify a population parameter

- Ex: What is the effect of increased atmospheric aerosols on crop yields? (Proctor et al., 2018)
- Ex: What is the effect of a vaccine booster shot on the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization?
- **You will talk a lot more about this in EDS 241!**

# [Very] short foray into study design

```{r sun-causes-cancer, echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.asp = 0.4}
par_og <- par(no.readonly = TRUE) # save original par
par(mar = rep(0, 4))
plot(c(-0.05, 1.2),
     c(0.39, 1),
     type = 'n',
     axes = FALSE)
text(0.59, 0.89, 'sun exposure', cex = 1)
rect(0.4, 0.8, 0.78, 1)
text(0.3, 0.49, 'use sunscreen', cex = 1)
rect(0.1, 0.4, 0.48, 0.6)
arrows(0.49, 0.78, 0.38, 0.62,
       length = 0.08, lwd = 1.5)
text(0.87, 0.5, 'skin cancer', cex = 1)
rect(0.71,0.4, 1.01, 0.6)
arrows(0.67, 0.78, 0.8, 0.62,
       length = 0.08, lwd = 1.5)
arrows(0.5, 0.5, 0.69, 0.5,
       length = 0.08, col = "gray")
text(0.595, 0.565, "?",
     cex = 1.5, col = "gray")
par(par_og) # restore original par
```

> Q: Does sunscreen lower risk of skin cancer?

- Experiment 
  + Randomly sample 50% of individuals and assign them the sunscreen "treatment", require the other 50% to wear no sunscreen
  + Follow individuals for 20 years, compare cancer outcomes
  
- Observational study
  + Collect data on sunscreen use, skin cancer, and sun exposure
  + Compare cancer rates for individuals with different sunscreen use habits
